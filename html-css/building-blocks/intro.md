PatternFly Core is based on the principles of [Atomic design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) and [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) (Block, Element, Modifier).

Atomic design is a methodology for creating design systems. In Atomic Design user interfaces are broken down into reusable components that can be re-assembled to create reusable interaction patterns.

PatternFly consists of isolated and modular structures that fall into three categories:
* Components are modular and independent structures concerned with presentation
* Layouts allow for organizing and grouping their immediate children on the page
* Demos illustrate how to assemble complex structures with components and layouts only
