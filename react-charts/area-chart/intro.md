In this scenario, you will learn how to use PatternFly React area chart components.

You will begin by adding a CSS selector to define the chart size...

<strong>Note:</strong> Katacoda is setting up a new React application for you. You'll be ready to code once the server starts and you can see "Welcome to PatternFly" on the lower pane.


Because Victory renders responsive containers, the Chart's width and height props do not determine the width and height of the chart in number of pixels, but instead define an aspect ratio for the chart. 

- The exact number of pixels will depend on the size of the container the chart is rendered into. 

- Typically, the parent container is set to the same width in order to maintain the aspect ratio.

You will continue by creating a simple area chart in the next step.
